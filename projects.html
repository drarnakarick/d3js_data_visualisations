        <h2 class="view"><a href="https://projects.ands.org.au/id/MS26">The Swinburne/ANDS Metadata Stores Project</a></font></h2>
        <p>In 2012, Swinburne was successful in obtaining funding from the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) for the development of <a href="http://mytardis.org/about/">MyTardis</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.qcif.edu.au">ReDBox</a> research data managment systems. The overall goal of the initiative was to implement a number of systems with the potental to support an university-wide solution for the discovery, sharing and re-use of rich data collections. 
        The benefit of such systems would result in improved research data management compliance, increased visibility around Swinburne research data activities, 
        a clear picture of research data needs for strategic planning, and increased data-discovery through high quality metadata.</p>

        <strong> Data management systems for for brain imaging and atom optics</strong>
        <p>One component of ANDS Project involves the capture of brain imaging metadata, through the implementation of Tardis software linked to the <em>Brain and Psychological Sciences Research Centre's (BPsyC)</em> state of the art instrumentation. Customisation of the new BPsyC-Tardis system is a collaboration 
        between Swinburne University and <a href="http://www.versi.edu.au">VeRSI</a>, and addresses the specific needs of BpsyC researchers. The sensitive nature of the data and the legislation governing data retention often restricts data sharing in this field. Consequently the main driver for BPsyC-Tardis is the 
        need for secure data storage, while still allowing collaborative sharing. Phase I development facilitates automatic capture, initial processing and storage of magnetoencephalographgy (MEG) non-invasive 'brain scanning' data, and the accompanying external metadata - for example audio and visual trigger information.</p>
     
        <p></p>A similar system was implemented for the <em>Centre for Quantum Optics and Science (CQOS - formerly CAOUS)</em>
        Phase I development of CAOUS-Tardis facilitates the collection, initial processing and storage of data from the Renishaw In Via Raman Spectrometer and Olympus IX81 Confocal Microscope, and the their accompanying external metadata; for example information about cell and bacteria samples.  
        Phase II development will include data ingestion from the Bruker Contour GT-K1 Optical Surface Profiles.</p>

       <h2 class="view"><a href="http://mytardis.org/about/">Swinburne Hacker Within</a></h2>
      Swinburne Hacker Within is a 1.5 hour weekly informal meetup for Swinburne PhD students, technical staff and researchers at all levels and from all disciplines: social sciences, biosciences, engineering, astronomy, business and design. 
      
      Why is it important? The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility, comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version control, automated documentation, and others.
      To avoid these pitfalls, the numerous Hacker Within Chapters exist for the prurpose of sharing skills and best practices for computational scientific applications.
