      <h1>Projects at Swinburne</h1>
      <hr> 
      <h2>Overview</h2>

     <p>At Swinburne my work is quite varied, from working on
      e-Research projects that focus on developing data management
      policy, and systems that promote and enable best practise in
      research, to research training, to liasing with industry
      organisations such those established
      under <a href="https://education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris"
      target="new">NCRIS</a>. For the Swinburne/ANDS Metadata Stores
      Project I was responsible for overseeing the development and
      implementation of two <em>MyTardis</em> systems (for brain
      imaging and atom optics) and the <em>Swin ReDBox</em> research
      metadata store. I also worked on the customisation and testing
      of the ReDBox system and the integration with Research Data
      Australia and the National Library Archive. As part of this work
      I developed the University's policies and guidelines concerning
      research data management and meeting compliance requirements set
      by the <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au">ARC</a>
      and <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au">NHMRC</a>. Occasionally I
      prepare responses to policy documents, consultation papers for
      Swinburne industry<C2><A0>and government organisations
      (e.g. NCRIS, ANDS, FAVeR, VeRSI/V3 Alliance). I'm also the
      Swinburne Research liason for Australian National Data
	       Service (project agreements/access).</p>

       I'm involved in a number of projects and activites that aim to building capacity and better support researchers.
       <ul>
	 <li> e-Research Triage Group (core team): provides software and development support for researchers. </li>
         <li> Research Technology Forum (member): provides recommendations to the Technology Governance Committee.  </li>     
         <li> Swinburne e-Research Working Group (chair): to monitor existing projects at Swinburne and make recommendations to the Research Technology Forum and DVC &amp;RD.</li>
         <li> Annual e-Research Symposium (organiser/chair): to showcase innovative e-Research across Swinburne and to identify existing barriers and gaps in capability.</li>
         <li> e-Science Working Group (member): W2.3 for 2016-2025 Australian Astronomy Decal Plan (building capacity nationally). </li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="view"><a href="http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/">Swinburne Hacker Within</a></h3>
       <p>Swinburne Hacker Within is weekly, multi-disciplinary meetup
       for Swinburne PhD students and researchers. The goal of the
       project is to introduce reserchers &ndash; primarily from the
       s ocial sciences, biosciences, astronomy, and economics &ndahs;
       to the plethora of open-source tools that can be used to
       increase productivity and enhance existing projects, and to
       encourage the development of off-shoot projects and
       contribution to community-developed research tools. There are
       two reasons why this is important:
    <ol>
    <li>To prepare researchers for alternative careers in the
    tech-industy. The rise of fellowship programs, for
    example <a href="http://insightdatascience.com">Insight Data
    Fellows</a> and <a href="http://www.s2ds.org"> Science to Data
    Science</a>. Skilled data scientists are in great demand on the
    European and US job market and researchers with analytical
    backgrounds are being offered jobs in leading
    tech-companies. </li>
    <li> The tenets of scientific research (e.g., data control,
       reproducibility, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail
       to make use of current development tools such as version
       control, testing, and comphensive/automatic documentation.  To
       avoid these pitfalls, the numerous Hacker Within Chapters exist
       for the purpose of sharing skills and best practices for
       computational scientific applications.</li>
    </ol>

      <h3 class="view"><a href="https://projects.ands.org.au/id/MS26">The Swinburne/ANDS Metadata Stores Project</a></font></h3>
      <p>In 2012, Swinburne was successful in obtaining funding from
      the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) for the development
      of <a href="http://mytardis.org/about/">MyTardis</a> and
      <a href="http://www.qcif.edu.au">ReDBox</a> research data
      managment systems. The overall goal of the initiative was to
      implement a number of systems with the potental to support an
      university-wide solution for the discovery, sharing and re-use
      of rich data collections, with Swinburne data collections fed
      directly
      to <a href="https://researchdata.ands.org.au/contributors/swinburne-university-of-technology">Research
      Data Australia</a>. Potential benefits of such systems inlcude
      improved research data management and compliance, increased
      visibility of Swinburne's research projects, data-discovery and
      the ability to assess needs and contribute to strategic
      planning decisions concering ITS infrastructure.</p>

      <h3 class="view"><a href="http://mytardis.org/about/">MyTardis and MicroTardis</a></h3>
      <p>One component of ANDS Project involves the capture of brain
      imaging metadata, through the implementation of Tardis software
      linked to the <em>Brain and Psychological Sciences Research
      Centre's (BPsyC)</em> state of the art
      instrumentation. Customisation of the new BPsyC-Tardis system is
      a collaboration between Swinburne University
      and <a href="http://www.versi.edu.au">VeRSI</a>, and addresses
      the specific needs of BpsyC researchers. The sensitive nature of
      the data and the legislation governing data retention often
      restricts data sharing in this field. Consequently the main
      driver for BPsyC-Tardis is the need for secure data storage,
      while still allowing collaborative sharing. Phase I development
      facilitates automatic capture, initial processing and storage of
      magnetoencephalographgy (MEG) non-invasive 'brain scanning'
      data, and the accompanying external metadata - for example audio
      and visual trigger information.</p>
     
      <p></p>A similar system was implemented for the <em>Centre for
      Quantum Optics and Science (CQOS - formerly CAOUS)</em> Phase I
      development of CAOUS-Tardis facilitates the collection, initial
      processing and storage of data from the Renishaw In Via Raman
      Spectrometer and Olympus IX81 Confocal Microscope, and the their
      accompanying external metadata; for example information about
      cell and bacteria samples.  Phase II development will include
      data ingestion from the Bruker Contour GT-K1 Optical Surface
      Profiles.</p>
