      <h3>Current work at Swinburne</h3> 
      
     <p>My work at Swinburne is quite varied. I've worked on
      e-Research projects that focus on developing data management
      policy, and systems that promote and enable best practise in
      research. Initially I worked on the joint Swinburne/Australian
      National Data Service (ANDS) Metadata Stores Project and was
      responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of
      two <em>MyTardis</em> systems (for brain imaging and atom
      optics) and the <em>Swin ReDBox</em> research metadata store. I
      also worked on customisation and testing of the ReDBox system
      and the integration with Research Data Australia (RDA) and the
      National Library Archive (NLA). In conjunction with this project
      I wrote Swinburne's policies and guidelines concerning research
      data management and meeting compliance requirements set by the
      Australian Reserach Council (ARC).
      <span style ="text-indent:40px"> Over the past year or so my
      focus has shifted to addressing the current issues that impact
      data-intensive research and figuring out solutions to these
      problems. These include the difficulty in storing and analysing
      large datasets &ndash; the <a href-="
      http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/09/a-very-short-history-of-big-data/"><em>big
      data</em></a> challenge, solving sustainability issues around
      large research infrastructure projects (e.g. NCRIS funded),
      up-skilling researchers to enable them to expoloit new data
      analysis tools and methods, providing alternative career paths
      in academia for data and software focussed reserchers, and
      providing training to enable scientists to transition into the
      tech-industry. In this respect I am somewhat biased towards
      astronomy and the issues arising from the next-generation of
      large-survey telescopes.</span></p>

       <p>Swinburne Hacker Within is weekly, multi-disciplinary meetup
       for Swinburne PhD students and researchers.  The goal of the
       project is to introduce reserchers to the plethora of
       open-source tools that can be used to increase productivity,
       enhance existing research projects, and demonstrate the value
       of
       
       social sciences, biosciences, engineering, astronomy, business and design. Why is it important? The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility, 
       comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version control, automated documentation, and others.
       To avoid these pitfalls, the numerous Hacker Within Chapters exist for the prurpose of sharing skills and best practices for computational scientific applications. </p>

      <p>In 2012, Swinburne was successful in obtaining funding from the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) for the development of <a href="http://mytardis.org/about/">MyTardis</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.qcif.edu.au">ReDBox</a> research data managment systems. The overall goal of the initiative was to implement a number of systems with the potental to support an university-wide solution for the discovery, sharing and re-use of rich data collections. 
      The benefit of such systems would result in improved research data management compliance, increased visibility around Swinburne research data activities, 
      a clear picture of research data needs for strategic planning, and increased data-discovery through high quality metadata.</p>

      <strong> Data management systems for for brain imaging and atom optics</strong>
      <p>One component of ANDS Project involves the capture of brain imaging metadata, through the implementation of Tardis software linked to the <em>Brain and Psychological Sciences Research Centre's (BPsyC)</em> state of the art instrumentation. Customisation of the new BPsyC-Tardis system is a collaboration 
      between Swinburne University and <a href="http://www.versi.edu.au">VeRSI</a>, and addresses the specific needs of BpsyC researchers. The sensitive nature of the data and the legislation governing data retention often restricts data sharing in this field. Consequently the main driver for BPsyC-Tardis is the 
      need for secure data storage, while still allowing collaborative sharing. Phase I development facilitates automatic capture, initial processing and storage of magnetoencephalographgy (MEG) non-invasive 'brain scanning' data, and the accompanying external metadata - for example audio and visual trigger information.</p>
     
      <p></p>A similar system was implemented for the <em>Centre for Quantum Optics and Science (CQOS - formerly CAOUS)</em>
      Phase I development of CAOUS-Tardis facilitates the collection, initial processing and storage of data from the Renishaw In Via Raman Spectrometer and Olympus IX81 Confocal Microscope, and the their accompanying external metadata; for example information about cell and bacteria samples.  
      Phase II development will include data ingestion from the Bruker Contour GT-K1 Optical Surface Profiles.</p>
