        <p style="text-align:justify;">My astronomy research focusses
        on galaxy formation in large galaxy clusters; specifically the
        three dimensional structure of dwarf and massive galaxies,
        their stellar populations, and how they evolve in the cluster
        environment. Primarily, I use data from
        the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst" target="_blank">Hubble
        Space Telescope (HST)</a>. Over the years I have also used the
        10m telescopes at
        the <a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/">W.M. Keck
        Observatory</a> (Hawaii – US), NOAO’s
        3.5m <a href="http://www.noao.edu/wiyn/" target="_blank">WIYN
        Hydra Telescope</a> (Tucson – US)
        and <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/"
        target="_blank">CTIO 4m Blanco Telescope</a> (La Serena –
        Chile), and numerous telescopes

     <h3><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433.2812K">Structure of Early-Type (E/S0) galaxies in the Atlas3D survey</a></h3>

    <p> The aim of this work was to connect the angular momentum based
    separation of early-type galaxies from the  <a href="http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/atlas3d/"
     target="new_window">ATLAS<sup>3D</sup> survey  <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.413..813C" 
     target="new_window">(Cappellari et al. 2011)</a> with
    properties of their nuclear surface brightness profiles.The
    ATLAS<sup>3D</sup> sample is defined in Paper I and consists of 260
    early-type galaxies, visually selected from a magnitude (brighter
    than -21.5 mag in the K-band) and volume limited (within 42 Mpc)
    parent sample. The analysis is based on Hubble Space Telescope
    archival images for 135 ATLAS<sup>3D</sup> galaxies with three imaging
    instruments: the Wide-field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), Advanced
    Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide-field Camera 3 (WFC3) images.

     <p><strong>Background:</strong> The ATLAS<sup>3D</sup> project
     combines a multi-wavelength survey of a complete sample of
     early-type galaxies within the local (42 Mpc) volume with
     numerical simulations and semi-analytic modeling of galaxy
     formation. The project aims to quantify the global stellar
     kinematics and dynamics of a statistically significant sample of
     objects to characterize the class of early-type galaxies, and
     relate this to their formation and evolution. The project is led
     by astronomers at the University of Oxford. It consists of
     optical integral-field spectroscopy using the SAURON
     integral-field unit on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT),
     radio and millimeter observation with the Westerbork Radio
     Synthesis Telescope (WRST), the IRAM 30m telescope and the
     Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy
     (CARMA).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?id=13324&mission=hst">Assessing the role of dissipation in the assembly of early-type galaxies</a></h3>
   
     <p>I am a Co-I of a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cycle-21
     program (PI: Krajnovic, GO-13324) to investigate a sample of
     earlytype galaxies (ETGs) which rotate slowly and
     have intermediate masses. The project extends the analysis
     of <a href="http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/433/4/2812"
     target="_blank">Krajnovic & Karick et al. (2013)</a>  and
     aims to; (i) determine to what extent and to what upper mass
     limit dissipative processes dominate the formation of ETGs and;
     (ii) to conclusively test the connection between nuclear
     structure and global parameters such as the stellar angular
     momentum, total mass and stellar velocity dispersion.</p>
     <p><strong>Status:</strong> ACS & WPC3 observations taken Nov 2013 -- Aug 2014</p>

     <strong>Background:</strong> Outcomes of violent dissipative and
     non-dissipative galaxy mergers are predicted to have different
     dynamical states and different nuclear profiles. The current
     paradigm is that flat (core) light profiles are results of
     coalescence of supermassive black holes in non-dissipative
     mergers of galaxies. These merger are also thought to produce
     remnants with low angular momentum (slow rotators) within a
     half-light radius. Matching the archival HST imaging with the
     volume-limited Atlas3D sample of nearby early-type galaxies (with
     integral-field stellar kinematics), indicates that the current
     paradigm is not complete.</p>

     <p>The HST/ACS Coma Cluster Treasury Survey is a Hubble Space
     Telescope (HST) program designed to survey both the core
     and an infall region of the richest local cluster of galaxies:
     the Coma cluster. The observations contain thousands of galaxies
     down to apparent magnitudes g=27.5 and I=26.6 mag. In addition,
     numerous supporting ground-based and space-based observing
     campaigns are being undertaken at other wavelengths. The Coma
     cluster provides an opportunity to study galaxies in an
     environment different to that in any previous large HST
     program. This is the first such survey of a nearby rich
     cluster. While the core of the Coma cluster is the densest galaxy
     environment in the local universe, the cluster as a whole harbors
     regions of widely varying galaxy densities. As such it allows one
     to study the role of environment on galaxy formation and
     evolution. A growing body of observational evidence suggests that
     the cluster environment is affecting not only the star formation
     histories of galaxies but also their very morphological
     properties.</p>
