        <hr> 
        <p style="text-align:justify;">My astronomy research focusses
        on galaxy formation in large galaxy clusters; specifically the
        three dimensional structure of dwarf and massive galaxies,
        their stellar populations, and how they evolve in the cluster
        environment. Primarily, I use data from
        the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst" target="_blank">Hubble
        Space Telescope (HST)</a>. Over the years I have also used the
        10m telescopes at
        the <a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/">W.M. Keck
        Observatory</a> (Hawaii – US), NOAO’s
        3.5m <a href="http://www.noao.edu/wiyn/" target="_blank">WIYN
        Hydra Telescope</a> (Tucson – US)
        and <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/"
        target="_blank">CTIO 4m Blanco Telescope</a> (La Serena –
        Chile), and numerous telescopes

     <h3><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433.2812K">Structure of Early-Type (E/S0) galaxies in the Atlas3D survey</a></h3>

    <p> The aim of this work was to connect the angular momentum based
    separation of early-type galaxies from the ATLAS3D survey with
    properties of their nuclear surface brightness profiles.The
    ATLAS3D sample is defined in Paper I and consists of 260
    early-type galaxies, visually selected from a magnitude (brighter
    than -21.5 mag in the K-band) and volume limited (within 42 Mpc)
    parent sample. The analysis is based on Hubble Space Telescope
    archival images for 135 ATLAS3D galaxies with three imaging
    instruments: the Wide-field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), Advanced
    Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide-field Camera 3 (WFC3) images.

     <p><strong>Background:</strong> The <a href="http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/atlas3d/"
     target="new_window">ATLAS<sup>3D</sup></a> project <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.413..813C" 
     target="new_window">(Cappellari et al. 2011)</a> combines a
     multi-wavelength survey of a complete sample of 260 early-type
     galaxies within the local (42Mpc) volume (1.16×105 Mpc3) with
     numerical simulations and semi-analytic modeling of galaxy
     formation. This project aims to quantify the global stellar kinematics
     and dynamics of a statistically significant sample of objects to
     characterize the class of early-type galaxies, and relate this to
     their formation and evolution. The observational part of the project
     consists of optical integral-field spectroscopy using the SAURON
     integral-field unit on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT), radio and
     millimeter observation with the Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope
     (WRST), the IRAM 30m telescope and the Combined Array for Research in
     Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA).</p>

    <h3>Assessing the role of dissipation in the assembly of early-type galaxies</h3>

     <p>The dominant processes that shape the angular momentum and nuclear profile of a galaxy -- Figure 13 from Krajnovic & Karick et al. (2013)[/caption]
     <p style="text-align:left;" align="center"> I am a Co-I of  a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cycle-21 program (PI: Krajnovic, GO-13324) to investigate a sample of earlytype galaxies (ETGs) which rotate slowly and have intermediate masses.  The project extends the analysis of <a href="http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/433/4/2812" target="_blank">Krajnovic & Karick et al. (2013)</a>  and  aims to; (i) determine to what extent and to what upper mass limit dissipative processes dominate the formation of ETGs and; (ii) to conclusively test the connection between nuclear structure and global parameters such as the stellar angular momentum, total mass and stellar velocity dispersion.</p>
     <p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><strong>Status:</strong> ACS & WPC3 observations are underway - Nov 2013 -- Aug 2014</p>
     <strong>Background:</strong> Outcomes of violent dissipative and non-dissipative galaxy mergers are predicted to have different dynamical states and different nuclear profiles. The current paradigm is that flat (core) light profiles are results of coalescence of supermassive black holes in non-dissipative mergers of galaxies. These merger are also thought to produce remnants with low angular momentum (slow rotators) within a half-light radius. Matching the archival HST imaging with the volume-limited Atlas3D sample of nearby early-type galaxies (with integral-field stellar kinematics), indicates that the current paradigm is not complete.</p>

     <h2>The HST/ACS  Coma Cluster Treasury Survey:</h2>
     
     <p><img class="size-full wp-image-88 alignright"

     src="http://arnakarick.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/durham_seminar-037.jpg"
     alt="" width="289" height="276" />The heart of
     the <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/coma/" target="_blank">Coma
     Cluster Treasury Survey</a> is a Hubble Space Telescope (<em>HST</em>)
     / Advanced Camera for Surveys (<em>ACS</em>) Treasury Program that was
     designed to survey both the core and an infall region of the richest
     local cluster of galaxies: the Coma cluster. The observations contain
     thousands of galaxies down to apparent magnitudes g=27.5 and I=26.6
     mag. In addition, numerous supporting ground-based and space-based
     observing campaigns are being undertaken at other wavelengths. The
     Coma cluster provides an opportunity to study galaxies in an
     environment different to that in any previous large HST program. This
     is the first such survey of a nearby rich cluster. While the core of
     the Coma cluster is the densest galaxy environment in the local
     universe, the cluster as a whole harbors regions of widely varying
     galaxy densities. As such it allows one to study the role of
     environment on galaxy formation and evolution. A growing body of
     observational evidence suggests that the cluster environment is
     affecting not only the star formation histories of galaxies but also
     their very morphological properties.</p>
